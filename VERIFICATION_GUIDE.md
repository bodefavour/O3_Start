# üîç How to Verify Your Hedera Transaction

## After Sending a Transaction

When you complete a transaction, you'll see a success screen with verification links. Here's how to verify it's real:

## Method 1: HashScan Explorer (Easiest) üëÅÔ∏è

### What is HashScan?
HashScan is Hedera's official blockchain explorer - like Etherscan for Ethereum.

### Steps to Verify:
1. **Click "HashScan Explorer" link** in the success modal
2. You'll see a page with transaction details:

```
Transaction Details:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transaction ID: 0.0.4826582@1761924855.321040929
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Status: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Consensus Timestamp: Oct 31, 2025 at 10:47:35 AM
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Type: TOKENTRANSFER
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Charged Fee: 0.00002 HBAR (~$0.001)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Transfers:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Token: 0.0.7167755 (BPUSD)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ From: 0.0.4826582 (-10.00)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ To: 0.0.7170237 (+10.00)
```

### What to Look For:
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Must be "SUCCESS"
- ‚úÖ **Type**: "TOKENTRANSFER" for token transfers
- ‚úÖ **Consensus Timestamp**: When it was finalized
- ‚úÖ **Transfers**: Shows exact from/to amounts

### HashScan URL Format:
```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/{TRANSACTION_ID}

Example:
https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.4826582@1761924855.321040929
```

## Method 2: Mirror Node API (For Developers) üîó

### What is Mirror Node?
Mirror Node is Hedera's REST API that provides transaction data in JSON format.

### Steps to Verify:
1. **Click "Mirror Node API" link** or
2. **Manually construct URL**:
   ```
   https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/transactions/{TRANSACTION_ID}
   ```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "transactions": [{
    "consensus_timestamp": "1761924855.321040929",
    "transaction_id": "0.0.4826582-1761924855-321040929",
    "valid_start_timestamp": "1761924855.321040929",
    "charged_tx_fee": 20000,
    "memo_base64": "U2VuZCAxMCBIQkFS",
    "result": "SUCCESS",
    "name": "CRYPTOTRANSFER",
    "token_transfers": [
      {
        "token_id": "0.0.7167755",
        "account": "0.0.4826582",
        "amount": -1000,
        "is_approval": false
      },
      {
        "token_id": "0.0.7167755",
        "account": "0.0.7170237",
        "amount": 1000,
        "is_approval": false
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Key Fields:
- `result`: "SUCCESS" means it worked
- `consensus_timestamp`: When it was confirmed
- `token_transfers`: Shows the token movement
- `charged_tx_fee`: Fee in tinybars (1 HBAR = 100,000,000 tinybars)

## Method 3: Check Account Balance

### Via HashScan:
```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/account/0.0.4826582
```

You'll see:
- HBAR balance
- Token balances (including BPUSD)
- Recent transactions
- Associated tokens

### Via Mirror Node API:
```
GET https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.4826582
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "account": "0.0.4826582",
  "balance": {
    "balance": 9998000000,
    "timestamp": "1761924855.321040929",
    "tokens": [
      {
        "token_id": "0.0.7167755",
        "balance": 990
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Method 4: Verify Token Info

### Check Your Token Exists:
```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7167755
```

Shows:
- Token Name: BorderlessPay USD
- Symbol: BPUSD
- Decimals: 2
- Total Supply
- Treasury Account
- Holders count

### Via API:
```
GET https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/tokens/0.0.7167755
```

## Understanding Transaction IDs

### Format:
```
{payer_account}@{consensus_timestamp}

Example:
0.0.4826582@1761924855.321040929
         ‚Üë           ‚Üë         ‚Üë
    Payer Acct   Seconds   Nanoseconds
```

### Components:
- **Payer Account**: Who paid the transaction fee (your operator account)
- **Consensus Timestamp**: When validators agreed on the transaction
  - Format: `seconds.nanoseconds` since Unix epoch
  - Unique for every transaction

## Common Questions

### Q: How long until transaction is confirmed?
**A**: 3-5 seconds typically. Hedera has the fastest finality of any public blockchain.

### Q: Can transactions be reversed?
**A**: No. Once consensus is reached, it's permanent and immutable.

### Q: How do I know it's really on the blockchain?
**A**: 
1. Check HashScan (public explorer)
2. Query Mirror Node API (public API)
3. Multiple nodes verified it (consensus)

### Q: What does "consensus timestamp" mean?
**A**: The exact moment when the network validators agreed the transaction is valid. This is your proof of execution time.

### Q: Why do I need to associate tokens first?
**A**: Hedera requires explicit opt-in to receive tokens. This prevents spam and gives users control.

### Q: How much does verification cost?
**A**: Verification is FREE. Reading from HashScan or Mirror Node costs nothing.

## For Your Hackathon Demo

### What to Show:
1. **Send Transaction**: Execute a real transfer
2. **Show Transaction ID**: Point to the unique ID
3. **Open HashScan**: Click the explorer link
4. **Highlight Details**: 
   - "See? SUCCESS status"
   - "Consensus timestamp shows when"
   - "Token transfer details are public"
5. **Open Mirror Node**: Show the raw JSON
6. **Check Account**: Show updated balance

### Talking Points:
- "Every transaction is verified by multiple nodes"
- "Public blockchain means anyone can verify"
- "Consensus timestamp proves exact execution time"
- "Transaction ID is cryptographically secure"
- "Sub-second finality - faster than any credit card"
- "Immutable record - can't be altered or deleted"

## Troubleshooting Verification

### HashScan shows "Transaction not found"
**Wait**: May take 2-3 seconds for indexing
**Check**: Transaction ID is correct (copy-paste)

### Mirror Node returns 404
**Wait**: Mirror nodes sync every few seconds
**Retry**: Click refresh after 5 seconds

### Status shows "INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID"
**Issue**: Recipient account doesn't exist
**Solution**: Use existing testnet account

### Balance not updated
**Clear**: Clear browser cache
**Wait**: May take 10-15 seconds
**Check**: Right account ID
