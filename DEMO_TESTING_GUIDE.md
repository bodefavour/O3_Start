# Demo Video Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide covers all features you can demonstrate in your O3 payment platform video, including Hedera blockchain integration that works **without HashPack wallet connection** using direct signing.

---

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Hedera Testnet Credentials (Required for Direct Signing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.YOUR_TESTNET_ACCOUNT
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=your-private-key-here
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet

# Dev Bypass (Use same as operator ID)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_ACCOUNT=0.0.YOUR_TESTNET_ACCOUNT

# WalletConnect (Optional - not needed for demo)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### How It Works
- Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_ACCOUNT` skips HashPack connection UI
- Transactions use your operator account via `direct-signer.ts`
- All modals (Send/Receive/Swap) will use your testnet account

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient balance" error
**Solution**: Fund your testnet account at https://portal.hedera.com/faucet

### Issue: Receive modal not showing account ID
**Solution**: Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_ACCOUNT` is set in `.env.local`

### Issue: SendModal falls back to backend API
**Expected**: This is correct! You're using direct signing (operator key)

### Issue: Transaction not appearing in HashScan
**Solution**: 
- Wait 3-5 seconds (testnet latency)
- Verify `HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet` in environment
- Check operator account has HBAR balance

### Issue: Swap modal doesn't execute transaction
**Expected**: Swap is mock UI only - just show the interface in video

---

## Environment Variable Checklist

Before recording, verify all required variables are set:

```bash
# Check your .env.local file contains:
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_ACCOUNT (same as operator ID)
‚úÖ HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
‚úÖ DATABASE_URL (for transactions/invoices/payroll)
```

Run this command to verify:
```bash
npm run dev
# Should start without errors
```
